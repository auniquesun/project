## Introduction
Please download data from [here](https://www.openacademic.ai/oag) and [here](https://www.aminer.cn/citation), and extract .zip files into this directory. Specifically, we use mag_papers_0.zip and dblp-citation-network v10. Note the size of these two data files is large, maybe it will spend a lot of time on downloading. The PWC dateset that was organized by us will be released later.
