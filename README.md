# Introduction
This repository published the source code of paper "Presenting Problems and Methods under Weak Supervision". In this paper, we put forward a framework that can present the problem and the method of a given paper automatically by means of sequence labeling. The framework consists of four steps and three algorithms. Extensive experiments on three public datasets which are [Aminer](https://www.aminer.org), Microsoft Academic Graph ([MAG](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/microsoft-academic-graph)) and Paper with Code ([PWC](https://github.com/zziz/pwc)) show the effectiveness of our framework. Details are provided in the code.

# Requirements
To reproduce or imporve our experiments, several softwares are necessary:
- python >= 3.6.6
- nltk >= 3.2.4
- tensorflow >= 1.13.1
- tensorflow-gpu >= 1.13.1
- numpy >= 1.16.4
